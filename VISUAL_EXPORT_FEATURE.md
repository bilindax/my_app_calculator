# 📊 Visual Export Feature (Better Graphics)

## Overview
We have enhanced the AutoCAD export functionality to include professional visual charts alongside the standard summary table. This provides "better graphics" and a more immediate visual understanding of the project quantities.

## New Features

### 1. Room Area Distribution (Pie Chart)
- **Visual:** A colorful pie chart showing the distribution of room areas.
- **Data:** Top 10 largest rooms are shown individually; smaller rooms are grouped into "Others".
- **Library:** Uses `matplotlib` for high-quality rendering.

### 2. Finish Quantities (Bar Chart)
- **Visual:** A bar chart comparing total areas of:
  - Plaster (Red)
  - Paint (Blue)
  - Floor Tiles (Green)
  - Wall Ceramic (Orange)
- **Data:** Aggregated from all project items.

## How It Works
1. When you click **"Insert Table to AutoCAD"** (in Quantities Tab or Summary Tab):
2. The app generates the standard data table.
3. It then uses `matplotlib` to generate two PNG images (charts) in a temporary folder.
4. These images are inserted into AutoCAD as **Raster Images** to the right of the summary table.

## Requirements
- **Python Library:** `matplotlib` (Already installed)
- **AutoCAD:** Must support `AddRaster` (Standard in most versions).

## Usage
No extra steps required! Just use the existing "Insert Table" button.
